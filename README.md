# res

calculate resistor resistances on the command line

## Install

```sh
git clone circles-png/res # or use `gh``
cargo install --path res
```

## Usage

```sh
$ res red r brown gol
Resolved input as red, red, brown, gold
Calculated resistance of resistor as 220Ω±5%
```

use res to calculate the resistance of a resistor from its 4-6 color bands

specify the colours with the full name (`gold`), or just a shorthand (`gol`)
